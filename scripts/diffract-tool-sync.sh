# Diffract universal tool sync — makes EVERY connected tool usable by the
# chat agent, driven entirely by the tool registry (no per-tool code).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: OpenShell >= 0.0.57 injects a tool's credential into the
# long-running agent daemon ONLY at sandbox CREATE (a provider attached after
# create reaches new exec sessions but not the running chat daemon). So for a
# tool to be usable *in chat*, its provider must be (a) attached at create and
# (b) egress-allowed (host + attributed binary). Both are derivable from the
# registry, so adding any new CLI is: add a registry entry + connect it — the
# deploy flow then wires it for chat automatically. No code per tool.
#
# A tool is "connected" iff a registry tool (diffract-tools.json) has a matching
# OpenShell provider of the same name (created by the connect flow).
#
#   diffract-tool-sync.sh providers            # -> comma list for NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX_EXTRA_PROVIDERS
#   diffract-tool-sync.sh egress  [<sandbox>]  # apply each connected tool's egress (apiHosts + binaries)
#   diffract-tool-sync.sh list                 # human-readable: connected tools + their hosts/binaries
